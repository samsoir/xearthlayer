# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

XEarthLayer is an open project that welcomes contributions from anyone. We are committed to providing a respectful, harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of background or experience level.

## Expected Behavior

- **Be respectful.** Disagreements happen — focus on the technical merits, not the person.
- **Be constructive.** Offer actionable feedback. If something is wrong, suggest how to fix it.
- **Be welcoming.** Remember that everyone was new once. Help newcomers get oriented.
- **Be pragmatic.** We value working software over process. Keep discussions focused and productive.
- **Accept feedback gracefully.** Code review is about improving the project, not personal judgment.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks
- Discriminatory language or exclusionary behavior
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Sustained disruption of discussions or project work
- Any conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all project spaces — issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channel associated with XEarthLayer.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All reports will be reviewed and handled with discretion. Maintainers reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that violate this code of conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban contributors for repeated or severe violations.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
