# Changelog

All notable changes to XEarthLayer will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.2] - 2025-12-15

### Changed

- Switch HTTP client TLS from OpenSSL to rustls for better cross-platform compatibility

### Fixed

- Release workflow builds now work correctly on GitHub Actions

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **Async Pipeline Architecture**: Complete rewrite of the tile generation pipeline using async/await for dramatically improved performance and resource efficiency
  - Async FUSE filesystem implementation using fuse3 with multi-threaded I/O
  - Request coalescing to deduplicate concurrent requests for the same tile
  - HTTP concurrency limiter to prevent network stack exhaustion
  - Cooperative cancellation support for FUSE timeout handling
  - Two-tier caching with memory and disk layers

- **TUI Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring interface showing:
  - Pipeline metrics (requests, cache hits, downloads, errors)
  - Active job tracking with status indicators
  - Log output panel for debugging

- **Linux Distribution Packages**:
  - Debian/Ubuntu packages via cargo-deb
  - RPM packages for Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE
  - AUR package (PKGBUILD) for Arch Linux
  - Pre-built Linux binary tarball

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing on PRs
  - Release workflow for building and publishing packages
  - Branch protection for main branch

### Changed

- Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.70
- Improved error handling throughout the pipeline
- Reduced log verbosity for routine operations (moved to DEBUG level)
- Refactored facade into smaller, testable units following Single Responsibility Principle

### Fixed

- Pipeline freeze when FUSE operations timeout ([#5](https://github.com/samsoir/xearthlayer/issues/5))
- TUI corruption from log output during DDS errors
- TUI dashboard display issues with metrics and job counters
- Memory cache sharing between pipeline stages
- DDS validation for malformed texture files

### Performance

- 10x+ improvement in tile generation throughput
- Eliminated thread pool exhaustion under heavy load
- Reduced memory usage through request coalescing
- Faster cache lookups with async I/O

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-01

### Added

- Initial release of XEarthLayer
- Regional scenery package system for on-demand satellite imagery
- Package manager with download, install, and library management
- FUSE-based virtual filesystem for X-Plane integration
- Support for Bing Maps and Google Maps imagery providers
- DDS texture generation with BC1/BC3 compression and mipmaps
- Two-tier caching (memory + disk) for performance
- CLI interface with package and config management
- Ortho4XP scenery package compatibility

### Notes

- Linux support only (Windows and macOS planned for future releases)
- Requires FUSE3 for filesystem mounting
